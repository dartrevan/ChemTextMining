{"text": "Took 10mg lipitor for approximately one year. Experienced lethargy, tingling in arms, trouble sleeping, irritability, anxiety, mild depression. Finally went off all statins when I experienced a particularly bad reaction when the doctor, with a gleam in his eye, recommended combining lipitor with Zeta. The results were so bad in terms of side-effects that I ceased all statins and discontinued the Zeta in short order. I now take no statins, no Zeta. Individually they have their own problems; combined they are extremely dangerous and, in my opinion, should be banned as a combination therapy. Probably safe in short doses, a very bad candidate for long-term use unless closely monitored and used in lowest possible safe dosage. Would warn other patients to NOT COMBINE LIPITOR OR OTHER STATIN WITH Zeta, a common tactic that you will most likely regret.

{"text": "SEVERE AND UNCHARACTERISTIC DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, AGGRESSION, AND MOOD SWINGS. I cannot stress this enough- my personality completely changed after beginning this medication. I am typically an easy going, positively thinking, emotionally stable, and motivated person. But after starting Lipitor I've gradually descended into a world of extreme anxiety, hopelessness, loneliness, and self loathing. I've never in my life been so depressed, so obsessively focused on morbid, terrifying thoughts, or so negative about everything in my life. After being off of this medication for only 48 hours, I am already beginning to see an improvement in my moods, but this will be a long journey back to my old self, I feel. Oh yes, and I also suffered from: Gas, Constipation, EXTREME FATIGUE, weight gain and bloating, and occasional bouts of diaharrea. It lowered my cholesterol, to be sure. But it also significantly lowered my quality of life. This website has been an absolute lifeline for me. My doctor had seemed so completely unwilling to accept that my symptoms could've possibly been related to my taking Lipitor. However, I know my body and know when things are not as they should be. I have been feeling this way since almost immediately after I took my first dose. Hearing that so many other people have experienced the same exact symptoms as me has given me the courage needed to STOP this medication. So many of my family members and friends have had bad reactions to this stuff- I can not trust it, and will be looking for another way to get my cholesterol under control, if possible. Be very careful and very informed before you start any new medication. Don't always trust the word of your doctor as the only word and take it at its face value.

{"text": "1/7/05-Chest pain, general weakness, depression, anxiety, just not myself , insomnia, fatigue, memory problems, inability to concentrate. Doctors unable to connect the dots (Lipitor = above symptoms). Sure it lowered my cholesterol. But at what cost? I told my doctor I was feeling weak. He commented I see NO reason for you to be weak (Even though he prescribed the Lipitor for me) Well needless to say that was the last time I saw him. I thought I had MS,Lupus,Fibromyalgia or some other illness that has the symptoms I was experiencing. I found that Lipitor could be the reason for all of these symptoms. So, on my own, I stopped the Lipitor (I was only on 10mg per day) Within 48 hours I felt my mood elevating back to normal. So far (I've been off of it for about 5 days now), my chest pain has improved by about 75%. This is no coincidence I am certain. Hopefully my other symptoms of fatigue, anxiety, memory and insomnia will alleviate as well. By the way. my new doctor had prescribed an anti-depressant for me. I never filled it, as my instincts told me it was something more. I am generally a well balanced type of person.

First he was a bit reluctant but in the following meeting he already told me that he had read about Lipitor's psychiatric side effects. He therefore put me off Lipitor completely and suggested a much lower dosage of 10mg Crestor. In addition, he prescribed a new medication: Niacin, beginning with 500mg the first month and then increasing to 1,000 in the second (with the ultimate aim of reaching 2,000 in the fourth monthly). Bottom line: When I discontinued Lipitor two months ago my LDL reached 165. This week my blood test indicated an LDL level of 124. So, after being helped by folks on this website I hope I can be of some help to others who suffer from statin side effects. Therefore, here is what I've done during the past two months: - Took 500mg of Niacin during the first months and 1,000mg during the second; - Took a total of 10 Crestor pills (10mg which are equivalent to 20mg of Lipitor) per month, i.e., one every three days. - Two natural pills of Phytosterol. - A cup of tea made of olive leafs. Now, I do believe that when I reach the maximum intake of Niacin in two months (2,000mg) the LDL will drop from 124 to 100 (the level required for diabetics).
