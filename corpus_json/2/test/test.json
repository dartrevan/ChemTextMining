I walk daily, and have recently added sit-ups to my regime. Many user reviews that I have read stated that they just don't get hungry and forget to eat. I can't say that I have the same experience. I do get hungry, but it's at normal meal times, and it does not take nearly as much food to fill me up. Meridia has taken away the urge to snack between meals, and for the most part, my sweet tooth. I do notice that before my menstrual cycle I do have cravings. Moderation is definitely the key. The only side effects I have noticed are dry mouth and some constipation which I can easily overlook considering how well I am progressing in this journey. My only words of advice are to not deprive yourself. If you really want something, eat it and enjoy it, just do so in moderation. Try not to treat this a diet, but as a lifestyle change you can stick with for the rest of your life.
