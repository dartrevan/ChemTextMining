I was able to flex and stress my muscles more without worrying about all the cramping. Went back on it and VOLA! muscle cramps are back.

Soon after, I began to have dizziness, headaches, then a progressively worsening weakness in my legs, and severe cramping of muscles. It was like having near constant charlie horses, with the worst pain in my feet, which seemed to be acting like a closing hand at times. There were times when I couldn't bend over at the store, and a couple of times when I didn't know if I could move without falling. It was like telling my legs to move, but they were refusing to do so. I was also taking melodica for arthritis, and I sent a message to my doctor that I thought the melodica was causing the problems. I didn't hear anything from him, so I quit the melodica but continued with the simvastatin. My condition got worse. Then I just quit taking the simvastatin, and within a few days the problems began to clear up. Every day since, things have gotten better, and I am back on the melodica with no side effects. I conclude that it was the simvastatin that caused the problems, and my doctor now seems to agree. I am waiting on new lab tests to see if there's any more need for a statin drug, and possibly go on a time release Niacin instead. I should mention that I took 10 mg Zocor many years ago with no noticeable side effects. I urge anyone who is taking either Zocor or the generic simvastatin to watch for side effects carefully. If you experience the headaches, dizziness, cramping of muscles and weakness in the legs, you have to ask yourself if your quality of life is being enhanced by the drug! Do ask your doctor right away if you can either take a lower dose or some other drug, like niacin.", "entities": {"T8": {"start": 259, "text": "charlie horses", "end": 273, "type": "ADE-Neg", "entity": "Disease"}, "T6": {"start": 205, "text": "cramping of muscles", "end": 224, "type": "ADE-Neg", "entity": "Disease"}, "T7": {"start": 290, "text": "pain in my feet", "end": 305, "type": "ADE-Neg", "entity": "Disease"}, "T4": {"start": 131, "text": "headaches", "end": 140, "type": "ADE-Neg", "entity": "Disease"}, "T5": {"start": 173, "text": "weakness in my legs", "end": 192, "type": "ADE-Neg", "entity": "Disease"}, "T2": {"start": 49, "text": "reduced my total cholesterol", "end": 77, "type": "BNE-Pos", "entity": "Disease"}, "T3": {"start": 120, "text": "dizziness", "end": 129, "type": "ADE-Neg", "entity": "Disease"}, "T28": {"start": 387, "text": "couldn't bend over", "end": 405, "type": "ADE-Neg", "entity": "Disease"}, "T21": {"start": 1447, "text": "headaches", "end": 1456, "type": "Other", "entity": "Disease"}, "T23": {"start": 1469, "text": "cramping of muscles", "end": 1488, "type": "Other", "entity": "Disease"}, "T22": {"start": 1458, "text": "dizziness", "end": 1467, "type": "Other", "entity": "Disease"}, "T24": {"start": 1493, "text": "weakness in the legs", "end": 1513, "type": "Other", "entity": "Disease"}, "T27": {"start": 595, "text": "arthritis", "end": 604, "type": "Other", "entity": "Disease"}}, "entities_pred": {"T8": {"start": 387, "type": "unknown", "entity": "Disease", "end": 400, "text": "couldn't bend"}, "T9": {"start": 466, "type": "unknown", "entity": "Disease", "end": 492, "text": "could move without falling"}, "T6": {"start": 290, "type": "unknown", "entity": "Disease", "end": 305, "text": "pain in my feet"}, "T7": {"start": 340, "type": "unknown", "entity": "Disease", "end": 352, "text": "closing hand"}, "T4": {"start": 198, "type": "unknown", "entity": "Disease", "end": 224, "text": "severe cramping of muscles"}, "T5": {"start": 250, "type": "unknown", "entity": "Disease", "end": 273, "text": "constant charlie horses"}, "T2": {"start": 131, "type": "unknown", "entity": "Disease", "end": 140, "text": "headaches"}, "T3": {"start": 163, "type": "unknown", "entity": "Disease", "end": 192, "text": "worsening weakness in my legs"}, "T0": {"start": 49, "type": "unknown", "entity": "Disease", "end": 77, "text": "reduced my total cholesterol"}, "T1": {"start": 120, "type": "unknown", "entity": "Disease", "end": 129, "text": "dizziness"}, "T14": {"start": 1447, "type": "unknown", "entity": "Disease", "end": 1456, "text": "headaches"}, "T15": {"start": 1458, "type": "unknown", "entity": "Disease", "end": 1467, "text": "dizziness"}, "T16": {"start": 1469, "type": "unknown", "entity": "Disease", "end": 1488, "text": "cramping of muscles"}, "T17": {"start": 1493, "type": "unknown", "entity": "Disease", "end": 1513, "text": "weakness in the legs"}, "T10": {"start": 517, "type": "unknown", "entity": "Disease", "end": 529, "text": "legs to move"}, "T11": {"start": 595, "type": "unknown", "entity": "Disease", "end": 604, "text": "arthritis"}, "T12": {"start": 789, "type": "unknown", "entity": "Disease", "end": 808, "text": "condition got worse"}, "T13": {"start": 934, "type": "unknown", "entity": "Disease", "end": 947, "text": "gotten better"}}, "id": 112665, "condition": " High Cholesterol"}
