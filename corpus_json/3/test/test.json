There is one side effect that has stuck with me still, it is much harder to orgasm, I'm not saying it killed my sex drive because it hasn't it just takes awhile to orgasm. I've also lost weight so far as my appetite has decreased. Please read do not go online looking up a ton of reviews it will scare you from taking it.

If you do decide to read reviews make sure it's reviews from people that took it atlas 2 months because again the first month is hell for me anyway.
