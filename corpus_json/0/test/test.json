I suffered from depression for years not knowing what it was and had a suicide attempt back in 1996. I am aware of it's symptoms now and can usually get myself back on track without medications. This time was different. The gym didn't help, talking to people didn't help. I am so glad that I had the courage to call my doctor and say I need help. I hope I don't need to be on medication for ever, but I am a much better wife and mother on it right now.", "entities": {"T8": {"start": 278, "type": "Other", "entity": "Disease", "end": 293, "text": "suicide attempt"}, "T9": {"start": 86, "type": "BNE-Pos", "entity": "Disease", "end": 96, "text": "felt great"}, "T6": {"start": 180, "type": "BNE-Pos", "entity": "Disease", "end": 205, "text": "don't have as much stress"}, "T7": {"start": 223, "type": "Indication", "entity": "Disease", "end": 233, "text": "depression"}, "T4": {"start": 124, "type": "BNE-Pos", "entity": "Disease", "end": 159, "text": "crying spells for no reason stopped"}, "T5": {"start": 166, "type": "BNE-Pos", "entity": "Disease", "end": 173, "text": "happier"}, "T2": {"start": 28, "type": "ADE-Neg", "entity": "Disease", "end": 36, "text": "headache"}, "T3": {"start": 101, "type": "BNE-Pos", "entity": "Disease", "end": 119, "text": "energy level is up"}}, "id": 123194, "condition": " Depression"}
