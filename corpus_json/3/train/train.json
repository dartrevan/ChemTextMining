I suffered with mild/moderate depression with panic attacks 10 yrs. ago. I was placed on xanax daily and Demerol. After 6 months of treatment and doing a cognitive therapy program I was doing a great deal better. However, the anxiety was there everyday to some degree. I have felt anxiety for the last 9 years to some degree or another. I continued to push it aside and tried my best to ignore it and just function. After an extremely stressful year I had one of the worst panic attacks I ever had in a hotel room. Needless to say I am now on Zoloft after much stubbornness of refusing to go on meds. I thought I could handle it all. It was bigger than me. I still have anxious thoughts, but my body doesn't react with the physical symptoms now. I still will get sweaty palms, a racing heart, etc., but to a MUCH lesser degree and it dissipates very quickly instead of escalading! I started on 25mg. for 7 days, then to 50mg. and my dr. increased me to 100mg. I didn't want to go that high, but I am glad I did!! I didn't know a medicine could help me this much.

Shortly after I became aware of severe leg and back pain, but did not associate it with Crestor as I also have degenerative disc disease. On Oct. 1 I saw my doctor and told him of pains, and recent edema in my ankles. He did not consider this significant. After another blood test showed my cholesterol went down from over 300 to 247, he still felt that was too high and increased my dose to 20 mg. Since then the muscle pain has been mostly in my neck and shoulders. I have been so fatigued and tired all the time. I can sit in my chair thinking of a short nap and wind up sleeping for over 12 hours. I have trouble breathing when I first try to relax. This has been very frightening for me, as I also get tired driving and have to limit my outings. The latest symptom I've noticed is blurry vision, which also scared me. I am so glad I decided to check out these side effects here and can relate to others. I am going off the Crestor and will let my doctor know.

It takes about a month for the body to adjust to this medication. I've tried Zoloft and Paxil, but they made me gain weight and I had clot of tiredness. I also tried amitryptyline which was awful - I gained weight immediately. Celexa has been nothing short of a miracle. One of the side effects I experienced were some night sweats - though, they could be due to my bad periods. The other side effect that never went away was a very low sex drive and a feeling of being non-emotional - not really ever crying or feeling ecstatically happy - just the same all the time. This was totally fine, but eventually, as my job and living situation got more secure, I didn't need as much of the dose. That is why I have slowly decreased my dose to 10mg. Though a small amount of anxiety has come back, so has the sex drive so that is good. The celexa helps me to feel in great spirits, calm and collected under stress, and peaceful.

Talked to my cardiologist about it, who is also taking Crestor he says, but without the side effects I am experiencing. Told me to go off it for a week to let it flush out of my system and see how I felt. I felt much, much better without it. I was able to flex and stress my muscles more without worrying about all the cramping. Went back on it and VOLA! muscle cramps are back. A nurse at the hospital I go to for all my cardiology help told me that Crestor is one of the worst drugs so far as the way it effects your muscles. Said HER doctor had put her on Crestor, but she won't take it. I feel I have no choice as I have inherited atherosclerosis (clogging of the arteries) from my fathers side of the family, a definite family history of this disease.

{"rating": 4, "title": "User Reviews & Ratings - Mucinex oral", "url": "http", "text": "I had some really tough mucus building up in my lungs, stopping me from breathing, which in turn kept me coughing both to try and get the mucus out and bc I wanted to breathe better. I had a nightmare of a night's sleep and decided i'd do something about the horrible mucus buildup. By recommendation from a friend, I bought Mucinex DM for extended 12h relief. Took one pill during the day and another at night before going to sleep, and it was the first night I slept so well. The medicine really did the job with stopping me from coughing, and when I got up in the morning, the mucus was easily coming out. Today is day 2 that i've been taking it, and that's when i started to feel the side effects. The worst feeling ever of wanting to vomit the entire day, my stomach was so upset (so much nausea!), my stool was softer (no diarrhea, just softer), and I seemed to be a little out of it at times. I arrived home from work wondering what was wrong with me and decided to check online what others say about Mucinex and I got so relieved to know I wasn't alone in feeling this horrible. Pros: It really stopped my chronic coughing and loosened up the tough mucus. Helped me sleep at night. Cons: Made my body feel so contorted and out of it in such a way i've never felt before. I have decided to stop taking this (though it was quite an expensive medicine) and find something else lighter to help me out. I don't know if i would recommend this to anyone i know bc i don't want them to feel the side effects. I know some people said they didn't feel anything, but still the feelings are not worth it. I did read in other's comments this medicine has stronger side effects in women.
