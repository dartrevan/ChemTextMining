After 6 months of treatment and doing a cognitive therapy program I was doing a great deal better. However, the anxiety was there everyday to some degree. I have felt anxiety for the last 9 years to some degree or another. I continued to push it aside and tried my best to ignore it and just function. After an extremely stressful year I had one of the worst panic attacks I ever had in a hotel room. Needless to say I am now on Zoloft after much stubbornness of refusing to go on meds. I thought I could handle it all. It was bigger than me. I still have anxious thoughts, but my body doesn't react with the physical symptoms now. I still will get sweaty palms, a racing heart, etc., but to a MUCH lesser degree and it dissipates very quickly instead of escalading! I started on 25mg. for 7 days, then to 50mg. and my dr. increased me to 100mg. I didn't want to go that high, but I am glad I did!! I didn't know a medicine could help me this much. It's a little sad to think I suffered for so long and there was medicine that could help so much!! I have only been taking this for 5 weeks.

After two weeks moved to 20 mg again extreme anxiety bad thoughts ect. This lasted right up to week 5 on the drug. Now let me tell you I feel amazing no more anxiety nothing I feel great. I will be sticking to 20 mg until I feel the need to higher the dose. There is one side effect that has stuck with me still, it is much harder to orgasm, I'm not saying it killed my sex drive because it hasn't it just takes awhile to orgasm. I've also lost weight so far as my appetite has decreased. Please read do not go online looking up a ton of reviews it will scare you from taking it. If you need just try and stick it out the first month WHICH IS HORRIBLE but once it kicks in it is great. If you do decide to read reviews make sure it's reviews from people that took it atlas 2 months because again the first month is hell for me anyway.

I also tried amitryptyline which was awful - I gained weight immediately. Celexa has been nothing short of a miracle. One of the side effects I experienced were some night sweats - though, they could be due to my bad periods. The other side effect that never went away was a very low sex drive and a feeling of being non-emotional - not really ever crying or feeling ecstatically happy - just the same all the time. This was totally fine, but eventually, as my job and living situation got more secure, I didn't need as much of the dose. That is why I have slowly decreased my dose to 10mg. Though a small amount of anxiety has come back, so has the sex drive so that is good. The celexa helps me to feel in great spirits, calm and collected under stress, and peaceful.
