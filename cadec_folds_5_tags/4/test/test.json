Difficult to sleep due to burning and pain. Took 20 mg for about a year. Doctor moved dosage to 40 mg. Very slowly over four months I began having leg cramps, noticed I was having difficulty picking my feet up, itching (tingling) around toes of right foot. Doctor suspected Neuropathy when Athlete's foot couldn't be detected. Neurologist said stop taking Lipitor immediately. The damage was done as it spread to my hands and up my legs. Have been off Lipitor eight months and still have problems. From what I read I fear this will be with me. This is dangerous as doctors are handing this out like candy and are not monitoring their patients closely.

{"text": "I am the advocate for my father who took this drug for 8 months before he passed from an aggressive form of brain cancer in 2005. The patient data is reported for him by me. Briefly, my research during my advocacy efforts during his illness indicated that this drug may have contributed to the onset of his particular form of brain cancer (glial cell related cancer). That cancer was diagnosed 6 months after his initial Rx for Lipitor -- he died 2 months after his initial cancer diagnosis. There were no warning signs, deterioration was very fast and debilitating -- he was a model totally healthy individual by conventional medical standards. My father was vibrant and could work any teen into the ground for a 75 year old, had great cholesterol numbers, but he was a cardiac patient. He and the cardiologist agreed to go to Lipitor to see if they could drive LDL below 100 (his lipid profile was very, very good by usual medical standards). I will say that there was no way any doctor could have known this would happen (my research showed that Lipitor could contribute to this cancer with prior risk factors for it which would have to have been environmental exposure and from what I know of my father's work history experience), but it would help if conventional medicine would listen to patients and their families about experiences that we all are reporting in places such as this. My father could not speak for himself as his form of brain cancer was so aggressive that he went from a totally normal guy walking with a cane from initial neurological damage at inital dx for brain cancer to bedridden, unable to speak, feed himself, do anything for himself in 10 days.

{"text": "I started experiencing severe leg cramping at night with the pain traveling to my bundocks and stomach as well. The pain was so bad I could not get out of the bed and had to crawl to get to the bathroom to take Advil. I asked my doctor what could have caused this and he said it was probably from the Lipitor. Recently I experienced extreme stomach pain that stretched to my side and back. The stomach pain came suddenly and it would come and go for a week before it became so bad I could not sleep. I had just gotten over a urinary tract infection (one of the side-effects) and I thought it had returned but the symptoms were different. I still had the urge to urinate constantly but it would come and go and I would have no symptoms for a day then it would return again. I remembered reading the hamlet that comes with the prescription drugs and it mentioning some of symptoms that I was experiencing. I stopped taking the Lipitor for a day and I did not have any more stomach pain or urgency. I also had been experiencing lack of energy for quite some time and I attributed this to stress but after reading this website I feel it was due to the Lipitor also. I don't think I will take this drug anymore and since I read that taking vitamin C can help you with your cholesterol I think I will try this method instead. I think there should be a better alternative to lowering cholesterol than such a potent drug that can cause so many side effects.
