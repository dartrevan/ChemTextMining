Like other drugs in its class (the statins), Lipitor can cause elevated liver enzymes. In clinical trials, this occurred in 0.7 percent of the patients, but the rate was much higher for those taking the 80 mg dose. Another serious side effect of Lipitor and other statins is a condition called rhabdomyolysis, in which muscle cells break down and release potentially toxic cell contents into the bloodstream., Symptoms of rhabdomyolysis include muscle pain, tenderness and weakness--most commonly in the calves and lower back. Malaise, fever, dark urine, vomiting and nausea can also be symptoms. The most feared consequence of rhabdomyolysis is acute kidney failure, occurring in 30-40% of the cases. Some of the warning signs of liver failure are nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, loss of appetite, dark urine, and generalized skin discoloration.

The week I started to take I had the chest ache, confirmed to be muscular by doctors. At the start of the second week, I accidentally took a dose in the morning instead of the night because I took the wrong pill (skipped the night dose). The day after I started to have the other symptoms. The worst one - the mouth one has faded, but the others remain. I found out too late grapefruit juice can make this drug stronger. I drank it some days during the first 2 weeks. Stopped drinking it. At the beginning of third week I took 50mg of coq10 per day for 3 days. I couldn't sense an improvement, but after stopping for other three days I will try again. (I need better evidence before buying a can of coq10, it is very expensive and hard to find around here). Will beg my cardiologist to let me try natural exercise before continuing statins. Giving it a 3, because it was effective , in a single month and with ezetimibe and exercise all my numbers are in very safe ranges. Please be careful about natural supplements. Homeopathy simply does not work - it is just water - The supplements that do work may also have side effects, just like the drugs.

{"text": "this was the last shot at using a statin to reduce cholesterol ldl. I have tried all the statin drugs, you know the very expensive drug of choice for all the doc's out there. For all of you who now have extremely low LDL and a bad case of joint pain to the extent that it is very arthritic or having bad muscle cramps that you never got prior to the drug, it is from the statins. The drug is able to decrease LDL through a mechanism which also destroys and depletes your bodies ability to make coq10. This is necessary for they health of muscles and joints (that's why you are experiencing the joint pains and numbness). Remember your heart is a muscle, guess what is happening to it with the depletion of the coq10??? If you do some research on the internet, you will find that all these statins make no claims/nor have studies shown them to reduce heart attacks, but they cause muscle problems i.e. your heart, this is based on the fact that they put younger and younger people on these drugs and. I would recommend that you do your own research versus just listening to the doctor who wants your LDL down to like below 130, neurosurgeons, who have studied this would tell you not to get it all too low. And just because your test come back and show your liver functions are fine and don't show any broken down muscle toxins in the blood doesn't mean the lack of coq10 isn't breaking down and damaging your muscles very slowly. Mine always showed fine and I had severe arthritis symptoms in knees and hip joints (never had this in my life before statins) and bad muscle cramps (also never got those until statins). Granted is you have high blood pressure, high LDL, over weight and maybe smoke, then you probably need something to lower the LDL, if you only have high LDL, you don't.

Then about 2-3 weeks later, woke up and could barely stand and walk. Legs and toes were numb (worse in left), weak, back pain and calves hurt terribly. Walking was possible but only with intense effort and pain. Couldn't stand for more than 1 or 2 minutes-too painful and weak. Waited a couple 3 weeks to see if it would clear up-did not. Went to doc. Took x-rays said everything fine, blood test fine. Interested in doing MRI-thinking necrotic nerve in lower spine. On an aside he said stop taking lipitor on an off chance it may be an uncommon reaction. I started looking up lipitor reactions and came across so much info on side effects it was startling. I look back to about 1 1/2 years ago when I no longer had that special feeling that all males experience in my organ and a decreased sex drive (not typical for me). At the time I attributed it to male menopause-being around 54. I went to my acupuncturist and was told my chee was dry. Had 4 treatments over as many weeks. Started to see some improvement. At the onset of symptoms I felt like I would imagine someone that had MS would feel like, swaying, pulling myself up stairs, dragging legs. After having stopped lipitor and acupuncture treatments, I would say I am at about 50 or 55%. I hope I continue to keep getting better as this has really hit my life at a bad time. My cholesterol did go down but If I knew I would have these kinds of problems I would never have started taking the drug nor will I EVER AGAIN take it irregardless of my cholesterol level.

I've never had consistent heart burn or indigestion, no signs of acid reflux, so I was confused as to why he would offer me this medication. The first day I took both pills, I experienced some dizziness and some nausea and some serious period like cramps. I was at work, so I just had to brush it off. It continued each time I took it. After about two days (two doses), the cramps continued and began inhibiting my menstrual cycle (which I was due to start). So, I googled the side effects of the drug, came across this site, and realized I wasn't the only one with those side effects, so I felt a little better about it. On the evening of 4/30, I suddenly got some serious chest pains, an elevated heart rate (I was laying down with my husband and this was similar to an \"I just finished running!\" heart rate), hot flashes, dizziness, sever stomach cramps, and weakness in my legs. I literally thought I was dying. It passed within 45 minutes and I was able to go to work the next day. At work (5/1), I was sitting at my desk and the same thing happened. I stepped out to get some air but it didn't work. A friend at work had to call an ambulance.

About a week ago I was taking a bath and my muscles in my lower abdomen started to contract then the cramp got higher. I got scared that I was having something bad.
