I hobbled to the bathroom and took a dose of Advil and was able to get back to sleep after about a half hour. I awoke this morning with about a 50% reduction in pain and it seems to have subsided as the day goes on. I will never take lipitor before bed again, I may cut the daily dose in half and possibly stop altogether if the pain persists at an intolerable level. Lipitor has lowered my cholesterol levels to the 180's. I had never had a reading below 218 in my life and it has been steadily rising over the last few years to a consistent level in the 240's. The ratio of bad to good cholesterol is in the acceptable zone and never had been before taking lipitor. So, all in all, the lipitor has done a good job.

My cholesterol level increased to slightly over 200 so my doc increased dosage to 40 mg a day. Hand and leg cramps returned. Hands diagnosed as carpal tunnel syndrome and I wore a hand brace to sleep several nights a week which controlled the symptoms.

I was told to stretch and exercise more but that has not helped my symptoms, which have continued to worsen.
