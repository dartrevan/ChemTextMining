A suggestion would be to use for 14 days, then change to another sleeping tablet such as temazepam or similar for 5 days, then go back to Zolpidem. I find by doing this, it works great.

I have also noticed some mild short term memory loss and no recall of events 1-2hrs the night before. All in all, I love this drug.

I've dealt with bronchitis most of my life and if you have chest congestion, this is the best OTC drug you can get. You do have to drink a lot of fluids so that your body has something to work with in order to thin out the mucus, so that you can cough it out. If that infection sets in your lungs you run the risk of pneumonia. Coughing is your bodies way of cleansing the lungs. Think of other ways your body \"cleanses\" itself. I know coughing is a hassel and it hurts, but its necessary. Oh and if the \"Mucinex\" people look at these posts you really should have more information on your products.

I had a nightmare of a night's sleep and decided i'd do something about the horrible mucus buildup. By recommendation from a friend, I bought Mucinex DM for extended 12h relief. Took one pill during the day and another at night before going to sleep, and it was the first night I slept so well. The medicine really did the job with stopping me from coughing, and when I got up in the morning, the mucus was easily coming out. Today is day 2 that i've been taking it, and that's when i started to feel the side effects. The worst feeling ever of wanting to vomit the entire day, my stomach was so upset (so much nausea!), my stool was softer (no diarrhea, just softer), and I seemed to be a little out of it at times. I arrived home from work wondering what was wrong with me and decided to check online what others say about Mucinex and I got so relieved to know I wasn't alone in feeling this horrible. Pros: It really stopped my chronic coughing and loosened up the tough mucus. Helped me sleep at night. Cons: Made my body feel so contorted and out of it in such a way i've never felt before. I have decided to stop taking this (though it was quite an expensive medicine) and find something else lighter to help me out. I don't know if i would recommend this to anyone i know bc i don't want them to feel the side effects. I know some people said they didn't feel anything, but still the feelings are not worth it.

Soon after, I began to have dizziness, headaches, then a progressively worsening weakness in my legs, and severe cramping of muscles.

There were times when I couldn't bend over at the store, and a couple of times when I didn't know if I could move without falling. It was like telling my legs to move, but they were refusing to do so. I was also taking melodica for arthritis, and I sent a message to my doctor that I thought the melodica was causing the problems. I didn't hear anything from him, so I quit the melodica but continued with the simvastatin. My condition got worse. Then I just quit taking the simvastatin, and within a few days the problems began to clear up. Every day since, things have gotten better, and I am back on the melodica with no side effects. I conclude that it was the simvastatin that caused the problems, and my doctor now seems to agree. I am waiting on new lab tests to see if there's any more need for a statin drug, and possibly go on a time release Niacin instead. I should mention that I took 10 mg Zocor many years ago with no noticeable side effects. I urge anyone who is taking either Zocor or the generic simvastatin to watch for side effects carefully.

With the 600mg tablet the box says that an adult can take 1 or 2 tablets at a time, but no more than 4 in a 24 hour period.

Taking this drug makes your adrenals stop producing cortisol and other adrenal hormones if taken in large enough quantities and for long periods of time. That's why you must wean. I will take months to get off the 5mg I take, as I just got down to 5mg after being up to 20mg. I have 1mg tabs too, so I can do this very slowly and safely.

I also tried amitryptyline which was awful - I gained weight immediately. Celexa has been nothing short of a miracle. One of the side effects I experienced were some night sweats - though, they could be due to my bad periods. The other side effect that never went away was a very low sex drive and a feeling of being non-emotional - not really ever crying or feeling ecstatically happy - just the same all the time. This was totally fine, but eventually, as my job and living situation got more secure, I didn't need as much of the dose. That is why I have slowly decreased my dose to 10mg. Though a small amount of anxiety has come back, so has the sex drive so that is good. The celexa helps me to feel in great spirits, calm and collected under stress, and peaceful.
