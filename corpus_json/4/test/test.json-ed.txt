{"rating": 4, "title": "User Reviews & Ratings - Mucinex oral", "url": "http", "text": "I had some really tough mucus building up in my lungs, stopping me from breathing, which in turn kept me coughing both to try and get the mucus out and bc I wanted to breathe better. I had a nightmare of a night's sleep and decided i'd do something about the horrible mucus buildup. By recommendation from a friend, I bought Mucinex DM for extended 12h relief. Took one pill during the day and another at night before going to sleep, and it was the first night I slept so well. The medicine really did the job with stopping me from coughing, and when I got up in the morning, the mucus was easily coming out. Today is day 2 that i've been taking it, and that's when i started to feel the side effects. The worst feeling ever of wanting to vomit the entire day, my stomach was so upset (so much nausea!), my stool was softer (no diarrhea, just softer), and I seemed to be a little out of it at times. I arrived home from work wondering what was wrong with me and decided to check online what others say about Mucinex and I got so relieved to know I wasn't alone in feeling this horrible. Pros: It really stopped my chronic coughing and loosened up the tough mucus. Helped me sleep at night. Cons: Made my body feel so contorted and out of it in such a way i've never felt before. I have decided to stop taking this (though it was quite an expensive medicine) and find something else lighter to help me out. I don't know if i would recommend this to anyone i know bc i don't want them to feel the side effects. I know some people said they didn't feel anything, but still the feelings are not worth it.

Also, have had some trouble with insomnia. After several weeks of the muscle issue I started looking at all these reviews online & decided to start cutting my 10 mg pill in half but it seems like things have gotten progressively worse with both legs now aching & also joint pain in hands & wrists. I stopped the Crestor yesterday & hope my aches & pains go away!!! After reading all the negative reviews about this & statins in general it really ticks me off that Dr's push this stuff so hard!!!
