debilitating.3mg per day.No more than that,but sometimes only 2mg.My thinking is actually clearer on this med than it was before because an anxiety attack would send my mind racing and unable to concentrate or focus.Not to mention the fact that I would get clammy hands,heart palpitations,severe chest pains and more making me think I was having a heart attack.When I started this medicine it all stopped completely.Now I feel absolutely normal and am not afraid to leave my house for fear of another attack like I used to get many times a week.Anxiety can cause you to become agoraphobic from fear of having another attack while away from your comfort zone like your own house.But yes,,it is addictive for sure,so if at any point in the future anyone that needs to stop taking this MUST taper off at a Very slow rate [like several weeks] or you will have very severe withdrawal symptoms which I understand is EXTREMELY unpleasant,also possible seizures and even death.I have no plans to stop because of it's effectiveness for me.Buspar,Effexor,Paxil,Wellbutrin,and all those types of drugs left me feeling unable to experience any natural highs or lows,somewhat like an automaton or a zombie.Alprazolam does not do that,that is why I like it.No,,it does not get me feeling buzzed except in the very initial stages of first use.I feel nothing from it now,just normal with no weird side
