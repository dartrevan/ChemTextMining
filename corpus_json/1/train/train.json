This medication is very effective in getting me to sleep, but long term use it becomes less effective as other reviews have also commented. A suggestion would be to use for 14 days, then change to another sleeping tablet such as temazepam or similar for 5 days, then go back to Zolpidem. I find by doing this, it works great. A side effect that I have noticed using long term 2> yrs is that I find during the day at work around 1200-1300 I am very tired. I have also noticed some mild short term memory loss and no recall of events 1-2hrs the night before. All in all, I love this drug. Very effective for short term sleep problems but unfortunately in Australia there has been wide negative media coverage due to idiots abusing drug, and as a result Dr's hesitation in prescribing.

debilitating.3mg per day.No more than that,but sometimes only 2mg.My thinking is actually clearer on this med than it was before because an anxiety attack would send my mind racing and unable to

all stopped completely.Now I feel absolutely normal and am not afraid to leave my house for fear of another attack like I used to get many times a week.Anxiety can cause you to become agoraphobic from fear of having another attack while away from your comfort zone like your own house.But yes,,it is addictive for sure,so if at any point in the future anyone that needs to stop taking this MUST taper off at a Very slow rate [like several weeks] or you will have very severe withdrawal symptoms which I understand is EXTREMELY unpleasant,also possible seizures and even death.I have no plans to stop because of it's effectiveness for me.Buspar,Effexor,Paxil,Wellbutrin,and all those types of drugs left me feeling unable to experience any natural highs or lows,somewhat like an automaton or a

I've dealt with bronchitis most of my life and if you have chest congestion, this is the best OTC drug you can get. You do have to drink a lot of fluids so that your body has something to work with in order to thin out the mucus, so that you can cough it out. If that infection sets in your lungs you run the risk of pneumonia. Coughing is your bodies way of cleansing the lungs. Think of other ways your body \"cleanses\" itself. I know coughing is a hassel and it hurts, but its necessary.

I used it to lose weight for my daughter's wedding but when I stopped taking it I kept exercising and eating right, and I at least maintained the weight loss of 21 pounds. I basically used it to jumpstart me at a point where I had plateaued. The wedding was 7 months ago and I have long since lost the commitment to my weight loss regime, and I did gain all but ten pounds back. Although I am exercising and dieting again I seem to be \"stuck\", so my doctor gave me a new prescription and I am hoping I will have good results again. To diet and exercise faithfully with zero results is discouraging. And, as my doctor explained, this drug was originally developed to treat depression, and the side effect was weight loss, so they started to market it for weight loss purposes instead. And so, an added benefit may be less depression, but who knows if that is a result of the drug or a result of looking in the mirror or having your clothes fit without cutting off your circulation.
