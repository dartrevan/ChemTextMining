The results were so bad in terms of side-effects that I ceased all statins and discontinued the Zeta in short order. I now take no statins, no Zeta. Individually they have their own problems; combined they are extremely dangerous and, in my opinion, should be banned as a combination therapy. Probably safe in short doses, a very bad candidate for long-term use unless closely monitored and used in lowest possible safe dosage. Would warn other patients to NOT COMBINE LIPITOR OR OTHER STATIN WITH Zeta, a common tactic that you will most likely regret.

{"text": "SEVERE AND UNCHARACTERISTIC DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, AGGRESSION, AND MOOD SWINGS. I cannot stress this enough- my personality completely changed after beginning this medication. I am typically an easy going, positively thinking, emotionally stable, and motivated person. But after starting Lipitor I've gradually descended into a world of extreme anxiety, hopelessness, loneliness, and self loathing. I've never in my life been so depressed, so obsessively focused on morbid, terrifying thoughts, or so negative about everything in my life. After being off of this medication for only 48 hours, I am already beginning to see an improvement in my moods, but this will be a long journey back to my old self, I feel. Oh yes, and I also suffered from: Gas, Constipation, EXTREME FATIGUE, weight gain and bloating, and occasional bouts of diaharrea. It lowered my cholesterol, to be sure. But it also significantly lowered my quality of life. This website has been an absolute lifeline for me. My doctor had seemed so completely unwilling to accept that my symptoms could've possibly been related to my taking Lipitor. However, I know my body and know when things are not as they should be. I have been feeling this way since almost immediately after I took my first dose. Hearing that so many other people have experienced the same exact symptoms as me has given me the courage needed to STOP this medication.

{"text": "1/7/05-Chest pain, general weakness, depression, anxiety, just not myself , insomnia, fatigue, memory problems, inability to concentrate. Doctors unable to connect the dots (Lipitor = above symptoms). Sure it lowered my cholesterol. But at what cost? I told my doctor I was feeling weak. He commented I see NO reason for you to be weak (Even though he prescribed the Lipitor for me) Well needless to say that was the last time I saw him. I thought I had MS,Lupus,Fibromyalgia or some other illness that has the symptoms I was experiencing. I found that Lipitor could be the reason for all of these symptoms. So, on my own, I stopped the Lipitor (I was only on 10mg per day) Within 48 hours I felt my mood elevating back to normal. So far (I've been off of it for about 5 days now), my chest pain has improved by about 75%. This is no coincidence I am certain.

In addition, he prescribed a new medication: Niacin, beginning with 500mg the first month and then increasing to 1,000 in the second (with the ultimate aim of reaching 2,000 in the fourth monthly). Bottom line: When I discontinued Lipitor two months ago my LDL reached 165. This week my blood test indicated an LDL level of 124. So, after being helped by folks on this website I hope I can be of some help to others who suffer from statin side effects. Therefore, here is what I've done during the past two months: - Took 500mg of Niacin during the first months and 1,000mg during the second; - Took a total of 10 Crestor pills (10mg which are equivalent to 20mg of Lipitor) per month, i.e., one every three days. - Two natural pills of Phytosterol. - A cup of tea made of olive leafs. Now, I do believe that when I reach the maximum intake of Niacin in two months (2,000mg) the LDL will drop from 124 to 100 (the level required for diabetics).

Like other drugs in its class (the statins), Lipitor can cause elevated liver enzymes. In clinical trials, this occurred in 0.7 percent of the patients, but the rate was much higher for those taking the 80 mg dose. Another serious side effect of Lipitor and other statins is a condition called rhabdomyolysis, in which muscle cells break down and release potentially toxic cell contents into the bloodstream., Symptoms of rhabdomyolysis include muscle pain, tenderness and weakness--most commonly in the calves and lower back. Malaise, fever, dark urine, vomiting and nausea can also be symptoms. The most feared consequence of rhabdomyolysis is acute kidney failure, occurring in 30-40% of the cases. Some of the warning signs of liver failure are nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, loss of appetite, dark urine, and generalized skin discoloration.

{"text": "this was the last shot at using a statin to reduce cholesterol ldl. I have tried all the statin drugs, you know the very expensive drug of choice for all the doc's out there. For all of you who now have extremely low LDL and a bad case of joint pain to the extent that it is very arthritic or having bad muscle cramps that you never got prior to the drug, it is from the statins. The drug is able to decrease LDL through a mechanism which also destroys and depletes your bodies ability to make coq10. This is necessary for they health of muscles and joints (that's why you are experiencing the joint pains and numbness). Remember your heart is a muscle, guess what is happening to it with the depletion of the coq10??? If you do some research on the internet, you will find that all these statins make no claims/nor have studies shown them to reduce heart attacks, but they cause muscle problems i.e. your heart, this is based on the fact that they put younger and younger people on these drugs and. I would recommend that you do your own research versus just listening to the doctor who wants your LDL down to like below 130, neurosurgeons, who have studied this would tell you not to get it all too low. And just because your test come back and show your liver functions are fine and don't show any broken down muscle toxins in the blood doesn't mean the lack of coq10 isn't breaking down and damaging your muscles very slowly. Mine always showed fine and I had severe arthritis symptoms in knees and hip joints (never had this in my life before statins) and bad muscle cramps (also never got those until statins). Granted is you have high blood pressure, high LDL, over weight and maybe smoke, then you probably need something to lower the LDL, if you only have high LDL, you don't.

{"text": "Started 2 years ago with 10 mg then 6 mos later doc upped to 20. About 3 mos ago I had several severe left leg cramps-never had them before. Then about 2-3 weeks later, woke up and could barely stand and walk. Legs and toes were numb (worse in left), weak, back pain and calves hurt terribly. Walking was possible but only with intense effort and pain. Couldn't stand for more than 1 or 2 minutes-too painful and weak. Waited a couple 3 weeks to see if it would clear up-did not. Went to doc. Took x-rays said everything fine, blood test fine. Interested in doing MRI-thinking necrotic nerve in lower spine. On an aside he said stop taking lipitor on an off chance it may be an uncommon reaction. I started looking up lipitor reactions and came across so much info on side effects it was startling. I look back to about 1 1/2 years ago when I no longer had that special feeling that all males experience in my organ and a decreased sex drive (not typical for me). At the time I attributed it to male menopause-being around 54. I went to my acupuncturist and was told my chee was dry. Had 4 treatments over as many weeks. Started to see some improvement. At the onset of symptoms I felt like I would imagine someone that had MS would feel like, swaying, pulling myself up stairs, dragging legs. After having stopped lipitor and acupuncture treatments, I would say I am at about 50 or 55%. I hope I continue to keep getting better as this has really hit my life at a bad time. My cholesterol did go down but If I knew I would have these kinds of problems I would never have started taking the drug nor will I EVER AGAIN take it irregardless of my cholesterol level.

The pain increased proportionately to the time I was on the drug and the dose increase. Neither my doctors nor I ever related these pains to Lipitor. I stopped Lipitor six months ago as an experiment. Within 3 weeks I had recovered about 50%. I ve not recovered past this point. I still can't walk without extreme pain.

{"text": "I had been taking Lipitor 10mg for 2 years. About 6 mons. ago, I decided to tell my Dr I was having muscle pain and leg cramps. He switched to Pravachol 20mg. I lasted about 2 weeks. The pain was worse. Then I decided to look on the internet to find out what was causing the pain. It was Statin. I looked that up and found what it does to the body. So, I decided to stop taking any drug and take some Q10 to build my body back up. Two months later went back on Lipitor with the Q10. 2 months later, the pain was back. Twice as bad as before, plus a whole bunch of other side effects, you see I'm seriously allergic to the Statin. And I know now, why I should have known this, but no one told me about it. When you are taking Statin and drink alcohol the side effects increase dramatically. When ever I drank, sipped a little wine, by body hurt so bad, I thought I had the flu. And no Aleve, or pain killer would help. I thought I was allergic to the alcohol. But now I know it was the Statin. Here are a list of the side-effects I had, that started slowly and in two years, became unbearable: Insomnia,abnormal dreams, depression, memory loss, photosensitivity, muscle pain, leg cramps, rhinitis, bronchitis, asthma, dry skin, tinnitus (left ear) taste loss, dry eyes, weight gain and finally hypertension. During the two years, I was on the Lipitor, all these symptoms started out slowly. First came the tinnitus. My Dr sent me to the ear Dr. Found no problem, I would have to live with it. Second, came depression, Dr put me on Zoloft. Then came the sinus problems, Dr put me on Rhinoceri. During all this I felt like I was 80 years old. My neck hurt, my hips hurt. We got a $3,000.00 sleep by number bed to relieve the pain. Didn't really help. Insomnia was constant. I got hooked on Tylenol PM. I gained a lot of weight. Went to Lindera to loss weight, so I could get off the Lipitor. Lost 40 lbs. Dr said to stay on Lipitor for prevention. This is when I decided to check it out on the internet. When I went back on the Lipitor, about 2 months ago, I had a small drink of wine at a wedding. That night my body aches were so bad, I could hardly stand it. Then two days later I came down with bronchitis, and asthma. I have asthma anyway, but it was the worse case I've had in 13 years. Then I had sinus problems again. My Dr took x-rays for pneumonia and sinus infection, Came back clear. My Dr wanted me to see an ear nose and throat Dr Then my blood pressure went up to 198/90. I have never in my life had high blood pressure. Dr put me on Neovasc. Then I had two horrible nightmares. I finally, went on the internet and looked at side effects for Lipitor. When I saw all the side-effects, I nearly died. I have all the symptoms. I stopped taking Lipitor that instant. That was one week ago. I'm starting feel a little better. I've gone to my Dr and asked him if he new about the alcohol related problem. He said, no. There is no warning on the prescription bottle, to tell you to watch out for a reaction with alcohol. The Dr is now doing tests, to see if there has been any damage to my heart and muscles. I also, asked for physical therapy for my left shoulder and neck. My left shoulder is almost immobile. I think the tinnitus in my left ear has been caused by the Lipitor. I hope it goes away soon. I also, lost my sense of taste during this whole thing. I would recommend anyone who has experienced any side effects increased by alcohol, to consider an allergic reaction to the drug. Dr was thinking about putting on another Statin drug.

{"text": "SEVERE FATIGUE IN MY BODY AND TIREDNESS AND MUSCLE PAINS IN MY HIPS THAT CONTINUE TO THIS DAY AFTER BEING OFF THE DRUG FOR ALMOST A YEAR. DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG!!!!!!!. I was put on this drug by my doctor for my somewhat high cholesterol. The next day, after starting this drug, I suddenly felt like I had aged to eighty years old overnight but did not connect it to starting Lipitor. Up until the start of this drug I felt that I was as young as I was in my twenties and wondered if this is how you might start feeling the affects of age, by waking up one morning and feeling all that age caught up with you and now you were older than your years. I took the drug for two terrible months and then had a blood test and my cholesterol had dropped. My doctor mailed me the results of my blood test but did not send me a new prescription like he had the last time so I did not know that he wanted me to get it refilled. So I went off of Lipitor and within two months I was feeling normal again and even took a job with the post office where I walked five miles a day with no problem. I did not associate my getting better with my coming off Lipitor, unfortunately. Then I had an appointment with my doctor and he said I should have refilled that prescription by calling his office. So I did and the next day, after taking only one pill, I was eighty years old again. This time I did associate it with the start of Lipitor and then read the warnings the drug store gives you with meds and found that my symptoms were the same as what they warned against. I am not a hypochondriac and I never read those warnings so this was not a head thing. I immediately went off the drug but a year later I am still have the same eighty years old feeling and do not know that I will ever be normal again. I do not understand how just one pill can do that and this time I am not recovering like I did the first time. This has ruined my life and I would never have taken Lipitor if I knew what I know now and I am so sorry that I ever heard of this drug. This is so severe that I think taking it for even a short time can cause permanent damage. My doctor, when I told him of all this, wanted to change statins because he was still worried about my cholesterol. I told him no more statins and he then prescribed Zeta, which he said was was less effective but was not a statin, which I am still afraid to take unless I improve from the affects of the Lipitor. He told me he was on Lipitor himself and that he had no problems but then said, well he did have neck pains that could have been a side affect, but that he had been on the drug two years before this developed. I told him of the information on this site that describes some people having that delayed reaction and I advised him to take himself off of this drug for a couple of weeks to see if the neck pains cleared up!

The worst side effects by far were the severe muscle pains and cramps, especially in my shins, front of my thighs, feet and hands. I noticed that they usually began about an hour after taking the Lipitor and would continue for several hours into the night. I was on Lipitor 2 years when I noticed that on a day that I had forgotten to take it, that I didn't experience the severe pains. I experimented by taking the medication one night and then not taking it the next. Sure enough, every night I took the medication I had the severe cramps/pains but the nights I didn't take it, either I didn't experience the pain at all or it was at a much lesser degree.

Deep bruising - I thought I was just being clumsy. Joint pain in spine, hips and elbows. Exhaustion. A colleague asked if I was on cholesterol medication and informed me there could be a connection - I found this website - amazed at all the similarities to me - I thought I was going MAD!!!

{"text": "I am the advocate for my father who took this drug for 8 months before he passed from an aggressive form of brain cancer in 2005. The patient data is reported for him by me. Briefly, my research during my advocacy efforts during his illness indicated that this drug may have contributed to the onset of his particular form of brain cancer (glial cell related cancer). That cancer was diagnosed 6 months after his initial Rx for Lipitor -- he died 2 months after his initial cancer diagnosis. There were no warning signs, deterioration was very fast and debilitating -- he was a model totally healthy individual by conventional medical standards. My father was vibrant and could work any teen into the ground for a 75 year old, had great cholesterol numbers, but he was a cardiac patient. He and the cardiologist agreed to go to Lipitor to see if they could drive LDL below 100 (his lipid profile was very, very good by usual medical standards). I will say that there was no way any doctor could have known this would happen (my research showed that Lipitor could contribute to this cancer with prior risk factors for it which would have to have been environmental exposure and from what I know of my father's work history experience), but it would help if conventional medicine would listen to patients and their families about experiences that we all are reporting in places such as this. My father could not speak for himself as his form of brain cancer was so aggressive that he went from a totally normal guy walking with a cane from initial neurological damage at inital dx for brain cancer to bedridden, unable to speak, feed himself, do anything for himself in 10 days.

I stopped taking the Lipitor for a day and I did not have any more stomach pain or urgency.

I see my symptoms over and over! So, I had blood tests done this week and have elevated creatine so was told today to stop Lipitor immediately, and will see my doctor next week.
