Talked to my cardiologist about it, who is also taking Crestor he says, but without the side effects I am experiencing. Told me to go off it for a week to let it flush out of my system and see how I felt. I felt much, much better without it. I was able to flex and stress my muscles more without worrying about all the cramping. Went back on it and VOLA! muscle cramps are back. A nurse at the hospital I go to for all my cardiology help told me that Crestor is one of the worst drugs so far as the way it effects your muscles. Said HER doctor had put her on Crestor, but she won't take it. I feel I have no choice as I have inherited atherosclerosis (clogging of the arteries) from my fathers side of the family, a definite family history of this disease. I feel I am destined to live with these horrible muscle cramps for the rest of my life.
