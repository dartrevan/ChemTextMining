I have felt anxiety for the last 9 years to some degree or another. I continued to push it aside and tried my best to ignore it and just function. After an extremely stressful year I had one of the worst panic attacks I ever had in a hotel room. Needless to say I am now on Zoloft after much stubbornness of refusing to go on meds. I thought I could handle it all. It was bigger than me. I still have anxious thoughts, but my body doesn't react with the physical symptoms now. I still will get sweaty palms, a racing heart, etc., but to a MUCH lesser degree and it dissipates very quickly instead of escalading! I started on 25mg. for 7 days, then to 50mg. and my dr. increased me to 100mg. I didn't want to go that high, but I am glad I did!! I didn't know a medicine could help me this much.

I take Oxy 40mg/2 a day, lyrica 75mg/ 2 a day, effexor-XR 75mg and zolpidem (AKA Stilton in Australia). Due to the drugs I take, I require Zolpidem to sleep. This medication is very effective in getting me to sleep, but long term use it becomes less effective as other reviews have also commented. A suggestion would be to use for 14 days, then change to another sleeping tablet such as temazepam or similar for 5 days, then go back to Zolpidem. I find by doing this, it works great. A side effect that I have noticed using long term 2> yrs is that I find during the day at work around 1200-1300 I am very tired. I have also noticed some mild short term memory loss and no recall of events 1-2hrs the night before. All in all, I love this drug.

I do get hungry, but it's at normal meal times, and it does not take nearly as much food to fill me up. Meridia has taken away the urge to snack between meals, and for the most part, my sweet tooth.

The only side effects I have noticed are dry mouth and some constipation which I can easily overlook considering how well I am progressing in this journey. My only words of advice are to not deprive yourself. If you really want something, eat it and enjoy it, just do so in moderation.

And so, an added benefit may be less depression, but who knows if that is a result of the drug or a result of looking in the mirror or having your clothes fit without cutting off your circulation.

The medicine really did the job with stopping me from coughing, and when I got up in the morning, the mucus was easily coming out. Today is day 2 that i've been taking it, and that's when i started to feel the side effects. The worst feeling ever of wanting to vomit the entire day, my stomach was so upset (so much nausea!), my stool was softer (no diarrhea, just softer), and I seemed to be a little out of it at times. I arrived home from work wondering what was wrong with me and decided to check online what others say about Mucinex and I got so relieved to know I wasn't alone in feeling this horrible. Pros: It really stopped my chronic coughing and loosened up the tough mucus. Helped me sleep at night. Cons: Made my body feel so contorted and out of it in such a way i've never felt before. I have decided to stop taking this (though it was quite an expensive medicine) and find something else lighter to help me out. I don't know if i would recommend this to anyone i know bc i don't want them to feel the side effects. I know some people said they didn't feel anything, but still the feelings are not worth it.

It was like telling my legs to move, but they were refusing to do so. I was also taking melodica for arthritis, and I sent a message to my doctor that I thought the melodica was causing the problems. I didn't hear anything from him, so I quit the melodica but continued with the simvastatin. My condition got worse. Then I just quit taking the simvastatin, and within a few days the problems began to clear up. Every day since, things have gotten better, and I am back on the melodica with no side effects. I conclude that it was the simvastatin that caused the problems, and my doctor now seems to agree. I am waiting on new lab tests to see if there's any more need for a statin drug, and possibly go on a time release Niacin instead. I should mention that I took 10 mg Zocor many years ago with no noticeable side effects. I urge anyone who is taking either Zocor or the generic simvastatin to watch for side effects carefully.

I had been on Zocor previously and my cholesterol had dropped from 180 to 111. Now the doctors want people to have their cholesterol level around 80, which seems a ridiculous low level to achieve. Since switching to Crestor I have experienced many, many muscle cramps, from my hips, my rib cage muscles, chest muscles, side muscles, feet, shoulder muscles and even under my chin around the larynx area. Talked to my cardiologist about it, who is also taking Crestor he says, but without the side effects I am experiencing. Told me to go off it for a week to let it flush out of my system and see how I felt. I felt much, much better without it. I was able to flex and stress my muscles more without worrying about all the cramping. Went back on it and VOLA! muscle cramps are back. A nurse at the hospital I go to for all my cardiology help told me that Crestor is one of the worst drugs so far as the way it effects your muscles. Said HER doctor had put her on Crestor, but she won't take it. I feel I have no choice as I have inherited atherosclerosis (clogging of the arteries) from my fathers side of the family, a definite family history of this disease. I feel I am destined to live with these horrible muscle cramps for the rest of my life.

He has been severely tired for last 3 or so years. In May of 2014 suffering major leg pain which grew constantly worse, could barely walk, used electric scooter to move around. Medical world could find nothing wrong. He stopped Simvastatin 7 weeks ago. Saw little change for 5 weeks and then remarkable improvement on a daily basis. He is walking without aid, rested, feeling better than he has for years. How many older people are suffering from these statins and thinking it is because they are old and have arthritis? I used Crestor for 3 days and couldn't function. Stopped it. Then I was put on Simvastatin about 5 years ago. Muscle and joint pain and lack of mobility followed - chalked up to old age and arthritis. I stopped the drug in June, against doctor's advice, and am doing much better. In my opinion the \"statin syndrome\" is a cleverly orchestrated hoax costing users mega bucks while dispensing dangerous health issues and major pain.

debilitating.3mg per day.No more than that,but sometimes only 2mg.My thinking is actually clearer on this med than it was before because an anxiety attack would send my mind racing and unable to concentrate or focus.Not to mention the fact that I would get clammy hands,heart palpitations,severe chest pains and more making me think I was having a heart attack.When I started this medicine it all stopped completely.Now I feel absolutely normal and am not afraid to leave my house for fear of another attack like I used to get many times a week.Anxiety can cause you to become agoraphobic from fear of having another attack while away from your comfort zone like your own house.But yes,,it is addictive for sure,so if at any point in the future anyone that needs to stop taking this MUST taper off at a Very slow rate [like several weeks] or you will have very severe withdrawal symptoms which I understand is EXTREMELY unpleasant,also possible seizures and even death.I have no plans to stop because of it's effectiveness for me.Buspar,Effexor,Paxil,Wellbutrin,and all those types of drugs left me feeling unable to experience any natural highs or lows,somewhat like an automaton or a zombie.Alprazolam does not do that,that is why I like it.No,,it does not get me feeling buzzed except in the very initial stages of first use.I feel nothing from it now,just normal with no weird side effects and no anxiety.I hope this might help some of you out there with your quest to feel better and hopefully normal once again.", "entities": {"T25": {"end": 812, "sentiment": "Worse", "text":

Now doctors don't like it..too addicting. I never found it addicting or given a 'high' feeling..I felt normal. As docs want you to get off of xanax they put you on all kinds of other psych meds. They are free to give those out. Zoloft was added to my meds about 6 years ago. It helped some but never stops the panic/anxiety disorder to make you feel 'human' like Xanax does. I tried to reduce the Zoloft to the point of getting off of it. Big mistake. The side effects for getting off Zoloft are horrible. Numbness in the mouth and hands, crying all the time, jitters, feeling like your skin is coming off. The side effects are far worse than continuing to take the Zoloft 100mg a night. Soon I will give it another try to get off Zoloft. Xanax works the best for me without addiction or a drugged feeling.

The Betta was awful and I'd tried just about EVERY other type of medicine out there including Insulin without success. I'm SO glad my Endocrinologist prescribed Victoza...it has completely changed my life. The once daily injection is a breeze and I've never experienced a \"low\" as my blood sugar is steady all day long. I LOVE this medication and I would highly recommend it to any Type 2 Diabetic.

Taking this drug makes your adrenals stop producing cortisol and other adrenal hormones if taken in large enough quantities and for long periods of time. That's why you must wean. I will take months to get off the 5mg I take, as I just got down to 5mg after being up to 20mg. I have 1mg tabs too, so I can do this very slowly and safely.

This was totally fine, but eventually, as my job and living situation got more secure, I didn't need as much of the dose. That is why I have slowly decreased my dose to 10mg. Though a small amount of anxiety has come back, so has the sex drive so that is good. The celexa helps me to feel in great spirits, calm and collected under stress, and peaceful. It also helped with severe PMS which is a bonus.

This is when I started Clonazepam(Glonoin) and was started at 1mg 4/day. My body built up a tolerance and I got to the point where I was taking up to 20mg/day just to stay leveled. I tried going off of it and went through hell and now I just take whatever whenever just to avoid the withdrawal hell. This med no longer helps and my dr. feels bad cuz I'm only 24 yrs old and he berets putting me on any form of benzo at my age. I wish I would've done more research, but its too late now. I don't recommend this or any benzo to anyone, but as for me I am surprised benzol are even legal drugs through prescription. That whole category, if you do the research, is one of the worst groups of meds above narcotics and sedatives.
