Talked to my cardiologist about it, who is also taking Crestor he says, but without the side effects I am experiencing. Told me to go off it for a week to let it flush out of my system and see how I felt. I felt much, much better without it. I was able to flex and stress my muscles more without worrying about all the cramping. Went back on it and VOLA! muscle cramps are back. A nurse at the hospital I go to for all my cardiology help told me that Crestor is one of the worst drugs so far as the way it effects your muscles. Said HER doctor had put her on Crestor, but she won't take it. I feel I have no choice as I have inherited atherosclerosis (clogging of the arteries) from my fathers side of the family, a definite family history of this disease. I feel I am destined to live with these horrible muscle cramps for the rest of my life.

This medication is very effective in getting me to sleep, but long term use it becomes less effective as other reviews have also commented. A suggestion would be to use for 14 days, then change to another sleeping tablet such as temazepam or similar for 5 days, then go back to Zolpidem. I find by doing this, it works great. A side effect that I have noticed using long term 2> yrs is that I find during the day at work around 1200-1300 I am very tired. I have also noticed some mild short term memory loss and no recall of events 1-2hrs the night before. All in all, I love this drug. Very effective for short term sleep problems but unfortunately in Australia there has been wide negative media coverage due to idiots abusing drug, and as a result Dr's hesitation in prescribing.

debilitating.3mg per day.No more than that,but sometimes only 2mg.My thinking is actually clearer on this med than it was before because an anxiety attack would send my mind racing and unable to

all stopped completely.Now I feel absolutely normal and am not afraid to leave my house for fear of another attack like I used to get many times a week.Anxiety can cause you to become agoraphobic from fear of having another attack while away from your comfort zone like your own house.But yes,,it is addictive for sure,so if at any point in the future anyone that needs to stop taking this MUST taper off at a Very slow rate [like several weeks] or you will have very severe withdrawal symptoms which I understand is EXTREMELY unpleasant,also possible seizures and even death.I have no plans to stop because of it's effectiveness for me.Buspar,Effexor,Paxil,Wellbutrin,and all those types of drugs left me feeling unable to experience any natural highs or lows,somewhat like an automaton or a

I've dealt with bronchitis most of my life and if you have chest congestion, this is the best OTC drug you can get. You do have to drink a lot of fluids so that your body has something to work with in order to thin out the mucus, so that you can cough it out. If that infection sets in your lungs you run the risk of pneumonia. Coughing is your bodies way of cleansing the lungs. Think of other ways your body \"cleanses\" itself. I know coughing is a hassel and it hurts, but its necessary.
