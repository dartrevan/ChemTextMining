To diet and exercise faithfully with zero results is discouraging.

And so, an added benefit may be less depression, but who knows if that is a result of the drug or a result of looking in the mirror or having your clothes fit without cutting off your circulation.

Now doctors don't like it..too addicting. I never found it addicting or given a 'high' feeling..I felt normal. As docs want you to get off of xanax they put you on all kinds of other psych meds. They are free to give those out. Zoloft was added to my meds about 6 years ago. It helped some but never stops the panic/anxiety disorder to make you feel 'human' like Xanax does. I tried to reduce the Zoloft to the point of getting off of it. Big mistake. The side effects for getting off Zoloft are horrible. Numbness in the mouth and hands, crying all the time, jitters, feeling like your skin is coming off. The side effects are far worse than continuing to take the Zoloft 100mg a night.

Also, have had some trouble with insomnia.
