I suffered with mild/moderate depression with panic attacks 10 yrs. ago. I was placed on xanax daily and Demerol. After 6 months of treatment and doing a cognitive therapy program I was doing a great deal better. However, the anxiety was there everyday to some degree. I have felt anxiety for the last 9 years to some degree or another. I continued to push it aside and tried my best to ignore it and just function. After an extremely stressful year I had one of the worst panic attacks I ever had in a hotel room. Needless to say I am now on Zoloft after much stubbornness of refusing to go on meds. I thought I could handle it all. It was bigger than me. I still have anxious thoughts, but my body doesn't react with the physical symptoms now. I still will get sweaty palms, a racing heart, etc., but to a MUCH lesser degree and it dissipates very quickly instead of escalading! I started on 25mg. for 7 days, then to 50mg. and my dr. increased me to 100mg. I didn't want to go that high, but I am glad I did!! I didn't know a medicine could help me this much.

Shortly after I became aware of severe leg and back pain, but did not associate it with Crestor as I also have degenerative disc disease. On Oct. 1 I saw my doctor and told him of pains, and recent edema in my ankles. He did not consider this significant. After another blood test showed my cholesterol went down from over 300 to 247, he still felt that was too high and increased my dose to 20 mg. Since then the muscle pain has been mostly in my neck and shoulders. I have been so fatigued and tired all the time. I can sit in my chair thinking of a short nap and wind up sleeping for over 12 hours. I have trouble breathing when I first try to relax. This has been very frightening for me, as I also get tired driving and have to limit my outings. The latest symptom I've noticed is blurry vision, which also scared me. I am so glad I decided to check out these side effects here and can relate to others. I am going off the Crestor and will let my doctor know.

I couldn't stand being around a lot of people without thinking there looking or Judi g me constantly. I always wanted to run away from social situation. Anyway I started at 10mg for first two weeks the first few days felt like I had a lot of energy and jitteriness. After that I had extreme anxiety sweating insomnia jaw clenching. After two weeks moved to 20 mg again extreme anxiety bad thoughts ect. This lasted right up to week 5 on the drug. Now let me tell you I feel amazing no more anxiety nothing I feel great. I will be sticking to 20 mg until I feel the need to higher the dose. There is one side effect that has stuck with me still, it is much harder to orgasm, I'm not saying it killed my sex drive because it hasn't it just takes awhile to orgasm. I've also lost weight so far as my appetite has decreased. Please read do not go online looking up a ton of reviews it will scare you from taking it. If you need just try and stick it out the first month WHICH IS HORRIBLE but once it kicks in it is great. If you do decide to read reviews make sure it's reviews from people that took it atlas 2 months because again the first month is hell for me anyway.

I am a self medicator as my doc knows I know how to use the drug safely. This is very important! It's time to get off the drug if possible, as I just had part of my kidney removed (cancer) and also have a tumor on my adrenal gland. I also seem to have \"Addison's like\"(not Addison's itself) symptoms(high potassium,low sodium). I want to see if my adrenals will start working for themselves again. I have to warn everybody: you MUST wean off this drug if taken for more than a week or so! Many doctors just have you stop a large dose and that is dangerous! Taking this drug makes your adrenals stop producing cortisol and other adrenal hormones if taken in large enough quantities and for long periods of time. That's why you must wean. I will take months to get off the 5mg I take, as I just got down to 5mg after being up to 20mg. I have 1mg tabs too, so I can do this very slowly and safely. Hopefully my adrenals will start making their own cortisol again. It's a great drug! It just has to be taken correctly if you are a long time user of it. Be careful if you are. Sorry for the book.

I had a nightmare of a night's sleep and decided i'd do something about the horrible mucus buildup. By recommendation from a friend, I bought Mucinex DM for extended 12h relief. Took one pill during the day and another at night before going to sleep, and it was the first night I slept so well. The medicine really did the job with stopping me from coughing, and when I got up in the morning, the mucus was easily coming out. Today is day 2 that i've been taking it, and that's when i started to feel the side effects. The worst feeling ever of wanting to vomit the entire day, my stomach was so upset (so much nausea!), my stool was softer (no diarrhea, just softer), and I seemed to be a little out of it at times. I arrived home from work wondering what was wrong with me and decided to check online what others say about Mucinex and I got so relieved to know I wasn't alone in feeling this horrible. Pros: It really stopped my chronic coughing and loosened up the tough mucus. Helped me sleep at night. Cons: Made my body feel so contorted and out of it in such a way i've never felt before. I have decided to stop taking this (though it was quite an expensive medicine) and find something else lighter to help me out. I don't know if i would recommend this to anyone i know bc i don't want them to feel the side effects. I know some people said they didn't feel anything, but still the feelings are not worth it. I did read in other's comments this medicine has stronger side effects in women.
