Been on it for over 4 years. Take a small(5mg)maintenance dose and go up to 30mg when I flare and wean back down when it's time. I am a self medicator as my doc knows I know how to use the drug safely. This is very important! It's time to get off the drug if possible, as I just had part of my kidney removed (cancer) and also have a tumor on my adrenal gland. I also seem to have \"Addison's like\"(not Addison's itself) symptoms(high potassium,low sodium). I want to see if my adrenals will start working for themselves again. I have to warn everybody: you MUST wean off this drug if taken for more than a week or so! Many doctors just have you stop a large dose and that is dangerous! Taking this drug makes your adrenals stop producing cortisol and other adrenal hormones if taken in large enough quantities and for long periods of time. That's why you must wean. I will take months to get off the 5mg I take, as I just got down to 5mg after being up to 20mg. I have 1mg tabs too, so I can do this very slowly and safely. Hopefully my adrenals will start making their own cortisol again. It's a great drug! It just has to be taken correctly if you are a long time user of it. Be careful if you are. Sorry for the book.

After two weeks moved to 20 mg again extreme anxiety bad thoughts ect. This lasted right up to week 5 on the drug. Now let me tell you I feel amazing no more anxiety nothing I feel great. I will be sticking to 20 mg until I feel the need to higher the dose. There is one side effect that has stuck with me still, it is much harder to orgasm, I'm not saying it killed my sex drive because it hasn't it just takes awhile to orgasm. I've also lost weight so far as my appetite has decreased. Please read do not go online looking up a ton of reviews it will scare you from taking it. If you need just try and stick it out the first month WHICH IS HORRIBLE but once it kicks in it is great. If you do decide to read reviews make sure it's reviews from people that took it atlas 2 months because again the first month is hell for me anyway.
