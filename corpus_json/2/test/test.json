This medication is very effective in getting me to sleep, but long term use it becomes less effective as other reviews have also commented. A suggestion would be to use for 14 days, then change to another sleeping tablet such as temazepam or similar for 5 days, then go back to Zolpidem. I find by doing this, it works great. A side effect that I have noticed using long term 2> yrs is that I find during the day at work around 1200-1300 I am very tired. I have also noticed some mild short term memory loss and no recall of events 1-2hrs the night before. All in all, I love this drug. Very effective for short term sleep problems but unfortunately in Australia there has been wide negative media coverage due to idiots abusing drug, and as a result Dr's hesitation in prescribing.

that's wat i got the rx for. worked like a charm for the pain. only been on it for a 11/2 wks. being a single mom of 3, falling asleep at the drop of a hat (even standing up) was scaring me! i don't know why it was doing it. i stopped taking it 3days ago. the 1st day w/out it, i was fine.not tired. now i feel the pain tho. hurts. the med even helped my back pain. i have 2 slipped disk, spinal arthritis, scoliosis,ect. so, the muscles, nerves in all was feeling better. my legs & hips hurt the most nerve wise. i had no pain after 11yrs of pain & i tell ya, that sure was the most wonderful feeling so i really hope they have something out there in place of it cuz taking care of my kids is my everything and i'm all they have. i'd love to have at least less pain in doing so w/out being drop dead tired! it was just too dangerous! it's not worth having no pain for their lives when i have to drive!! btw, the epilepsy is controlled, thank goodness! oh, and at night, i'd find myself standing up out of bed or sitting up sleeping!! creepy! i'd wake up sitting up or standing next to my bed! boy was i really freaked out! i am on other meds. i still have to talk to the pharmacy & dr. it may be that or just an adverse reaction. not sure. i already asked b4 i even took it if it wud interact w/ any of my meds tho. they said no. yet, they didn't look it up to be sure either. go figure. can't trust everyone! i hope this helps someone out there. even tho it may be a long review, i had plenty to say about my odd experience w/ this rx. thank u out there and whoever u may be, if u have pain", "entities": {"T14": {"end": 725, "sentiment": "Helpful", "text": "no pain", "entity": "Disease", "start": 718, "type": "BNE-Pos"}, "T15": {"end": 745, "sentiment": "Helpful", "text": "pain", "entity": "Disease", "start": 741, "type": "Indication"}, "T16": {"end": 964, "sentiment": "Helpful", "text": "less pain", "entity": "Disease", "start": 955, "type": "BNE-Pos"}, "T17": {"end": 1004, "sentiment": "Helpful", "text": "w/out being drop dead tired", "entity": "Disease", "start": 977, "type": "BNE-Pos"}, "T10": {"end": 614, "sentiment": "Unknown", "text": "scoliosis", "entity": "Disease", "start": 605, "type": "Indication"}, "T11": {"end": 585, "sentiment": "Unknown", "text": "slipped disk", "entity": "Disease", "start": 573, "type": "Indication"}, "T13": {"end": 690, "sentiment": "Unknown", "text": "my legs & hips hurt", "entity": "Disease", "start": 671, "type": "Indication"}, "T18": {"end": 1062, "sentiment": "Helpful", "text": "no pain", "entity": "Disease", "start": 1055, "type": "BNE-Pos"}, "T19": {"end": 1133, "sentiment": "Helpful", "text": "epilepsy is controlled", "entity": "Disease", "start": 1111, "type": "BNE-Pos"}, "T8": {"end": 562, "sentiment": "Helpful", "text": "back pain", "entity": "Disease", "start": 553, "type": "Indication"}, "T9": {"end": 603, "sentiment": "Unknown", "text": "spinal arthritis", "entity": "Disease", "start": 587, "type": "Indication"}, "T6": {"end": 517, "sentiment": "Helpful", "text": "pain", "entity": "Disease", "start": 513, "type": "Indication"}, "T7": {"end": 496, "sentiment": "Unknown", "text": "not tired", "entity": "Disease", "start": 487, "type": "Other"}, "T4": {"end": 173, "sentiment": "Unknown", "text": "fibromyalgia", "entity": "Disease", "start": 161, "type": "Other"}, "T5": {"end": 259, "sentiment": "Helpful", "text": "pain", "entity": "Disease", "start": 255, "type": "Indication"}, "T2": {"end": 41, "sentiment": "Unknown", "text": "chronic pain", "entity": "Disease", "start": 29, "type": "Indication"}, "T3": {"end": 67, "sentiment": "Unknown", "text": "epileptic", "entity": "Disease", "start": 58, "type": "Indication"}, "T21": {"start": 1455, "type": "Drugname", "entity": "Medication", "end": 1457, "text": "b4"}, "T20": {"end": 1275, "sentiment": "Worse", "text": "wake up sitting up or standing", "entity": "Disease", "start": 1245, "type": "Indication"}, "T23": {"end": 145, "sentiment": "Unknown", "text": "violent seizures", "entity": "Disease", "start": 129, "type": "Indication"}, "T22": {"end": 1790, "sentiment": "Helpful", "text": "pain", "entity": "Disease", "start": 1786, "type": "Other"}, "T25": {"end": 669, "sentiment": "Helpful", "text": "muscles, nerves in all was feeling better", "entity": "Disease", "start": 628, "type": "BNE-Pos"}, "T24": {"end": 1320, "sentiment": "Unknown", "text": "freaked out", "entity": "Disease", "start": 1309, "type": "Other"}, "T27": {"end": 1230, "sentiment": "Worse", "text": "standing up out of bed or sitting up sleeping", "entity": "Disease", "start": 1185, "type": "ADE-Neg"}, "T26": {"end": 332, "sentiment": "Worse", "text": "falling asleep", "entity": "Disease", "start": 318, "type": "ADE-Neg"}}, "id": 9952, "condition": " Other"}
