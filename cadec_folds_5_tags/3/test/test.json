{"text": "I had been taking Lipitor 10mg for 2 years. About 6 mons. ago, I decided to tell my Dr I was having muscle pain and leg cramps. He switched to Pravachol 20mg. I lasted about 2 weeks. The pain was worse. Then I decided to look on the internet to find out what was causing the pain. It was Statin. I looked that up and found what it does to the body. So, I decided to stop taking any drug and take some Q10 to build my body back up. Two months later went back on Lipitor with the Q10. 2 months later, the pain was back. Twice as bad as before, plus a whole bunch of other side effects, you see I'm seriously allergic to the Statin. And I know now, why I should have known this, but no one told me about it. When you are taking Statin and drink alcohol the side effects increase dramatically. When ever I drank, sipped a little wine, by body hurt so bad, I thought I had the flu. And no Aleve, or pain killer would help. I thought I was allergic to the alcohol. But now I know it was the Statin. Here are a list of the side-effects I had, that started slowly and in two years, became unbearable: Insomnia,abnormal dreams, depression, memory loss, photosensitivity, muscle pain, leg cramps, rhinitis, bronchitis, asthma, dry skin, tinnitus (left ear) taste loss, dry eyes, weight gain and finally hypertension. During the two years, I was on the Lipitor, all these symptoms started out slowly. First came the tinnitus. My Dr sent me to the ear Dr. Found no problem, I would have to live with it. Second, came depression, Dr put me on Zoloft. Then came the sinus problems, Dr put me on Rhinoceri. During all this I felt like I was 80 years old. My neck hurt, my hips hurt. We got a $3,000.00 sleep by number bed to relieve the pain. Didn't really help. Insomnia was constant. I got hooked on Tylenol PM. I gained a lot of weight. Went to Lindera to loss weight, so I could get off the Lipitor. Lost 40 lbs. Dr said to stay on Lipitor for prevention. This is when I decided to check it out on the internet. When I went back on the Lipitor, about 2 months ago, I had a small drink of wine at a wedding. That night my body aches were so bad, I could hardly stand it. Then two days later I came down with bronchitis, and asthma. I have asthma anyway, but it was the worse case I've had in 13 years. Then I had sinus problems again. My Dr took x-rays for pneumonia and sinus infection, Came back clear. My Dr wanted me to see an ear nose and throat Dr Then my blood pressure went up to 198/90. I have never in my life had high blood pressure. Dr put me on Neovasc. Then I had two horrible nightmares. I finally, went on the internet and looked at side effects for Lipitor. When I saw all the side-effects, I nearly died. I have all the symptoms. I stopped taking Lipitor that instant. That was one week ago. I'm starting feel a little better. I've gone to my Dr and asked him if he new about the alcohol related problem. He said, no. There is no warning on the prescription bottle, to tell you to watch out for a reaction with alcohol. The Dr is now doing tests, to see if there has been any damage to my heart and muscles. I also, asked for physical therapy for my left shoulder and neck. My left shoulder is almost immobile. I think the tinnitus in my left ear has been caused by the Lipitor. I hope it goes away soon. I also, lost my sense of taste during this whole thing. I would recommend anyone who has experienced any side effects increased by alcohol, to consider an allergic reaction to the drug. Dr was thinking about putting on another Statin drug.

{"text": "SEVERE FATIGUE IN MY BODY AND TIREDNESS AND MUSCLE PAINS IN MY HIPS THAT CONTINUE TO THIS DAY AFTER BEING OFF THE DRUG FOR ALMOST A YEAR. DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG!!!!!!!. I was put on this drug by my doctor for my somewhat high cholesterol. The next day, after starting this drug, I suddenly felt like I had aged to eighty years old overnight but did not connect it to starting Lipitor. Up until the start of this drug I felt that I was as young as I was in my twenties and wondered if this is how you might start feeling the affects of age, by waking up one morning and feeling all that age caught up with you and now you were older than your years. I took the drug for two terrible months and then had a blood test and my cholesterol had dropped. My doctor mailed me the results of my blood test but did not send me a new prescription like he had the last time so I did not know that he wanted me to get it refilled. So I went off of Lipitor and within two months I was feeling normal again and even took a job with the post office where I walked five miles a day with no problem. I did not associate my getting better with my coming off Lipitor, unfortunately. Then I had an appointment with my doctor and he said I should have refilled that prescription by calling his office. So I did and the next day, after taking only one pill, I was eighty years old again. This time I did associate it with the start of Lipitor and then read the warnings the drug store gives you with meds and found that my symptoms were the same as what they warned against. I am not a hypochondriac and I never read those warnings so this was not a head thing. I immediately went off the drug but a year later I am still have the same eighty years old feeling and do not know that I will ever be normal again. I do not understand how just one pill can do that and this time I am not recovering like I did the first time. This has ruined my life and I would never have taken Lipitor if I knew what I know now and I am so sorry that I ever heard of this drug. This is so severe that I think taking it for even a short time can cause permanent damage. My doctor, when I told him of all this, wanted to change statins because he was still worried about my cholesterol. I told him no more statins and he then prescribed Zeta, which he said was was less effective but was not a statin, which I am still afraid to take unless I improve from the affects of the Lipitor. He told me he was on Lipitor himself and that he had no problems but then said, well he did have neck pains that could have been a side affect, but that he had been on the drug two years before this developed. I told him of the information on this site that describes some people having that delayed reaction and I advised him to take himself off of this drug for a couple of weeks to see if the neck pains cleared up! I advise, DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG!!!!!.", "id": 3000927, "entities": {"T8": {"start": 1137, "type": "Drugname", "entity": "Medication", "end": 1144, "text": "Lipitor"}, "T9": {"start": 1410, "type": "Drugname", "entity": "Medication", "end": 1417, "text": "Lipitor"}, "T6": {"end": 607, "sentiment": "Adverse", "text": "feeling all that age caught up with you", "entity": "Disease", "start": 568, "type": "ADE-Neg"}, "T7": {"start": 933, "type": "Drugname", "entity": "Medication", "end": 940, "text": "Lipitor"}, "T4": {"end": 339, "sentiment": "Adverse", "text": "felt like I had aged to eighty years old overnight", "entity": "Disease", "start": 289, "type": "ADE-Neg"}, "T5": {"start": 375, "type": "Drugname", "entity": "Medication", "end": 382, "text": "Lipitor"}, "T2": {"end": 39, "sentiment": "Adverse", "text": "TIREDNESS", "entity": "Disease", "start": 30, "type": "ADE-Neg"}, "T3": {"end": 67, "sentiment": "Adverse", "text": "MUSCLE PAINS IN MY HIPS", "entity": "Disease", "start": 44, "type": "ADE-Neg"}, "T1": {"end": 25, "sentiment": "Adverse", "text": "SEVERE FATIGUE IN MY BODY", "entity": "Disease", "start": 0, "type": "ADE-Neg"}, "T14": {"start": 2291, "type": "Drugname", "entity": "Medication", "end": 2295, "text": "Zeta"}, "T15": {"start": 2429, "type": "Drugname", "entity": "Medication", "end": 2436, "text": "Lipitor"}, "T16": {"start": 2459, "type": "Drugname", "entity": "Medication", "end": 2466, "text": "Lipitor"}, "T17": {"end": 2545, "sentiment": "Unknown", "text": "neck pains", "entity": "Disease", "start": 2535, "type": "Other"}, "T10": {"end": 1574, "sentiment": "Unknown", "text": "hypochondriac", "entity": "Disease", "start": 1561, "type": "Other"}, "T11": {"start": 1950, "type": "Drugname", "entity": "Medication", "end": 1957, "text": "Lipitor"}, "T12": {"end": 1355, "sentiment": "Adverse", "text": "I was eighty years old", "entity": "Disease", "start": 1333, "type": "ADE-Neg"}, "T13": {"end": 1735, "sentiment": "Adverse", "text": "eighty years old feeling", "entity": "Disease", "start": 1711, "type": "ADE-Neg"}, "T18": {"end": 236, "sentiment": "Unknown", "text": "high cholesterol", "entity": "Disease", "start": 220, "type": "Other"}}}
